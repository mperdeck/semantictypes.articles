<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type-checking" target="_blank">Static typing</a>
     is a great help in keeping your code bug free and maintainable. Take for example:
</p>
<pre>
public int Mymethod(Person person)
{
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>
    A few good things are happening here:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    <b>Documentation</b>: You know right away that this method takes a Person and returns an integer.
    </li>
    <li>
<b>Machine Checking</b>: The compiler has been told as well. That means that this is not just documentation that can get out of date.
        The compiler actually makes sure that what you're reading here is true.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Tooling</b>: Finally, Visual Studio has been told too - enabling you to quickly find out how Person is defined.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The problem is that out of the box, C# only gives you types based on the physical representation of your data in computer memory. 
    Integers are 32 bit numbers, strings are collections of characters, etc. So the compiler won't even give you warning
    when you wind up with this:
</p>
<pre>
double d = GetDistance();
double t = GetTemperature();

... Many complicated lines further ...

// Adding a temperature to a distance doesn't make sense, 
// but the compiler won't warn you.
double probablyWrong = d + t;
</pre>
<p>
    Ok, you could use better naming here.  <i>totalDistance</i> instead of <i>d</i>.  <i>surfaceTemperature</i> instead of <i>t</i>.
    But the compiler still isn't going to warn you, because it still doesn't know that <i>totalDistance</i> is a distance, not just a double. 
</p>
    <p>
        Another example:
    </p>
<pre>
/// &lt;summary>
/// Sends an email.
/// &lt;/summary>
/// &lt;param name="emailAddress">
/// Hopefully this is a valid email address.
/// But there is no way to be sure. We could be getting anything here really.
/// 
/// If someone passes a phone number by mistake, the compiler will
/// happily compile this, and we'll get a run time exception. Happy debugging.
/// &lt;/param>
/// &lt;param name="message">
/// Message to send.
/// &lt;/param>
public void SendEmail(string emailAddress, string message)
{
}
</pre>    
<p>
    The problem is that we're telling the compiler that the method can take 
    any string as the email address, while actually it can only take a valid email address, which is very different.
</p>
<p>
    The solution to these issues is to inform the compiler about the various value types in our domain - distances, temperatures, email addresses, etc., even
    if they could be represented in memory by some built in type such as double or integer.
    That way, it can
    catch more bugs for us. This is where semantic typing comes in. 
</p>

<h2>Semantic Types</h2>
<p>
    Imagine that C# included a type <i>EmailAddress</i> that can only contain a valid email address:
</p>
<pre>
// Constructor throws exception if passed in email address is invalid
var validEmailAddress = new EmailAddress("kjones@megacorp.com");

var validEmailAddress2 = new EmailAddress("not a valid email address"); // throws exception
</pre>
<p>
    Now we can guarantee that we only pass valid email addresses to the SendEmail method:
</p>

<pre>
// emailAddress will always contain a valid email address
public void SendEmail(EmailAddress emailAddress, string message)
{
}

...

SendEmail(validEmailAddress, "message"); // can only pass an valid email address
</pre>
<p>
    To prevent needless exception handling, we need a static <i>IsValid</i> method 
    that checks whether an email address is valid:
</p>
<pre>
bool isValidEmailAddress = EmailAddress.IsValid("kjones@megacorp.com"); // true
bool isValidEmailAddress2 = EmailAddress.IsValid("not a valid email address"); // false
</pre>
<p>
    Finally, we need a <i>Value</i> property to retrieve the underlying string value.
    This is read-only, to ensure that after the EmailAddress has been created, it is 
    immutable (cannot be changed).
</p>
<pre>
var validEmailAddress = new EmailAddress("kjones@megacorp.com");

string emailAddressString = validEmailAddress.Value; // "kjones@megacorp.com"
</pre>

<p>
    Such an <i>EmailAddress</i> type is an example of a semantic type:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    <b>Type based on meaning, not on physical storage</b>:
        An EmailAddress is physically still a string.
        What makes it different is the way we think of that string - as an email address, not as a random collection of characters.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Type safe</b>:
Having a distinct EmailAddress type enables the        
compiler to ensure you're not using some common string where a valid email address is expected -
        just as the compiler stops you from using a string where an integer is expected.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Guaranteed to be valid</b>:

    Because you can't create an EmailAddress based on an invalid email address,
        and you can't change it after it has been created,
        you know for sure that every EmaillAddress represents a valid email address.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Documentation</b>:
        When you see a parameter of type EmailAddress, you know right away it contain an email address,
        even if the parameter name is unclear.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Besides an EmailAddress type, you could have a ZipCode type, a PhoneNumber type, a Distance type, a Temperature type, etc.
</p>

<p>
    Semantic typing is obviously useful, but many people do not use this approach because they fear that introducing
    semantic types involves lots of typing and boilerplate.
</p>

<p>
The rest of this article shows first how to implement a semantic type, and then how to factor out all the common
    code to make creating a new semantic type nice and quick.
</p>

<h2>Creating a semantic type, first take</h2>
<p>
    Before seeing how to create semantic types in general, lets create a specific semantic type: EmailAddress.
</p>
<p>
    Seeing that an EmailAddress is physically a string, you might be tempted to inherit from string:
</p>
<pre>
// Doesn't compile
public class EmailAddress: string
{
}
</pre>
<p>
    However, this doesn't compile, because string is 
    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/88c54tsw.aspx" target="_blank">sealed</a>, so you cannot derive from it. The same goes for int, double, etc.
    You can't even inherit from DateTime.
</p>

<p>
    So, we'll store the string value inside the EmailAddress class. Note that the setter is private. That way,
    code outside the class cannot change the value:
</p>
<pre>
public class EmailAddress
{
    public string Value { get; private set; }
}
</pre>
<p>
    Add a static IsValid method that returns true if the given string is a valid email address:
</p>
<pre>
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

public class EmailAddress
{
    public string Value { get; private set; }

    <b>public static bool IsValid(string emailAddress)
    {
        return Regex.IsMatch(emailAddress,
            @"^(?("")("".+?(?&lt;!\\)""@)|(([0-9a-z]((\.(?!\.))|[-!#\$%&'\*\+/=\?\^`\{\}\|~\w])*)(?&lt;=[0-9a-z])@))" +
            @"(?(\[)(\[(\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}\])|(([0-9a-z][-\w]*[0-9a-z]*\.)+[a-z0-9][\-a-z0-9]{0,22}[a-z0-9]))$",
            RegexOptions.IgnoreCase);
    }</b>
}
</pre>
<p>
    Add the constructor. This takes a string with hopefully a valid email address.
    If it isn't an email address, throw an exception.
</p>

<pre>
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

public class EmailAddress
{
    public string Value { get; private set; }

    public static bool IsValid(string emailAddress)
    {
        return Regex.IsMatch(emailAddress,
            @"^(?("")("".+?(?&lt;!\\)""@)|(([0-9a-z]((\.(?!\.))|[-!#\$%&'\*\+/=\?\^`\{\}\|~\w])*)(?&lt;=[0-9a-z])@))" +
            @"(?(\[)(\[(\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}\])|(([0-9a-z][-\w]*[0-9a-z]*\.)+[a-z0-9][\-a-z0-9]{0,22}[a-z0-9]))$",
            RegexOptions.IgnoreCase);
    }

    <b>public EmailAddress(string emailAddress)
    {
        if (!IsValid(emailAddress)) { throw new ArgumentException(string.Format("Invalid email address: {0}", emailAddress)); }
        Value = emailAddress;
    }</b>
}
</pre>
<p>
    That gives us the basics. Note that with this implementation, an EmailAddress cannot be changed after it has been created - it is immutable.
    If you want a new email address, you have to create a new EmailAddress object - and the constructor will ensure that your new email address is valid as well.
</p>
<p>
    However, there is one more thing to implement: equality. When you use simple strings to store email addresses,
    you expect to be able to compare them by value:
</p>
<pre>
string emailAddress1 = "kjones@megacorp.com";
string emailAddress2 = "kjones@megacorp.com";
bool equal = (emailAddress1 == emailAddress2); // true
</pre>

<p>
    Because of this, we'll want the same behaviour with EmailAddresses:
</p>
<pre>
var emailAddress1 = new EmailAddress("kjones@megacorp.com");
var emailAddress2 = new EmailAddress("kjones@megacorp.com");
bool equal = (emailAddress1 == emailAddress2); // true
</pre>

<p>
    Because EmailAddress is a 
    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/t63sy5hs.aspx" target="_blank">reference type</a>,
    by default the equality operator only checks whether the two EmailAddresses are physically the same.
    However, we want to compare the underlying email adresses.
</p>
<p>
    To make this happen, we have to implement the System.IEquatable&lt;T> interface and override the
    Object.Equals and Object.GetHashCode methods and the == and != operators
    (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd183755.aspx" target="_blank">full details</a>).
    The result is this:
</p>
<pre>
public class EmailAddress<b> : IEquatable&lt;EmailAddress&gt;</b>
{
    public string Value { get; private set; }

    public EmailAddress(string emailAddress)
    {
        if (!IsValid(emailAddress)) { throw new ArgumentException(string.Format("Invalid email address: {0}", emailAddress)); }
        Value = emailAddress;
    }

    public static bool IsValid(string emailAddress)
    {
        return Regex.IsMatch(emailAddress,
            @"^(?("")("".+?(?&lt;!\\)""@)|(([0-9a-z]((\.(?!\.))|[-!#\$%&'\*\+/=\?\^`\{\}\|~\w])*)(?&lt;=[0-9a-z])@))" +
            @"(?(\[)(\[(\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}\])|(([0-9a-z][-\w]*[0-9a-z]*\.)+[a-z0-9][\-a-z0-9]{0,22}[a-z0-9]))$",
            RegexOptions.IgnoreCase);
    }

<b>#region equality

    public override bool Equals(Object obj)
    {
        //Check for null and compare run-time types. 
        if ((obj == null) || (!(obj is EmailAddress)))
        {
            return false;
        }

        return (Value.Equals(((EmailAddress)obj).Value));
    }

    public override int GetHashCode()
    {
        return Value.GetHashCode();
    }

    public bool Equals(EmailAddress other)
    {
        if (other == null) { return false; }

        return (Value.Equals(other.Value));
    }

    public static bool operator ==(EmailAddress a, EmailAddress b)
    {
        // If both are null, or both are same instance, return true.
        if (System.Object.ReferenceEquals(a, b))
        {
            return true;
        }

        // If one is null, but not both, return false.
        // Have to cast to object, otherwise you recursively call this == operator.
        if (((object)a == null) || ((object)b == null))
        {
            return true;
        }

        // Return true if the fields match:
        return a.Equals(b);
    }

    public static bool operator !=(EmailAddress a, EmailAddress b)
    {
        return !(a == b);
    }

#endregion</b>
}
</pre>

<h2>Factoring out the boilerplate</h2>

<p>
    Obviously, the EmailAddress class as it stands has lots of boilerplate that is not specific to email addresses.
    We'll factor this out into a base class <i>SemanticType</i>. This can then be used to quickly define lots of semantic types.
</p>
<p>
    Here is what EmailAddress will look like once we're done:
</p>
<pre>
public class EmailAddress : SemanticType&lt;string>
{
    public static bool IsValid(string value)
    {
        return (Regex.IsMatch(value,
                        @"^(?("")("".+?(?&lt;!\\)""@)|(([0-9a-z]((\.(?!\.))|[-!#\$%&'\*\+/=\?\^`\{\}\|~\w])*)(?&lt;=[0-9a-z])@))" +
                        @"(?(\[)(\[(\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}\])|(([0-9a-z][-\w]*[0-9a-z]*\.)+[a-z0-9][\-a-z0-9]{0,22}[a-z0-9]))$",
                        RegexOptions.IgnoreCase));
    }

    // Constructor, taking an email address. The base constructor handles validation
    // and storage in the Value property.
    public EmailAddress(string emailAddress) : base(IsValid, typeof(EmailAddress), emailAddress) { }
}
</pre>
<p>
    Here we only specify what is EmailAddress specific, leaving the boilerplate to a base class <i>SemanticType</i>
    (which we'll get to in the next section):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The SemanticType base class will be storing the underlying value, so it needs to be 
        <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/512aeb7t.aspx" target="_blank">generic</a>, 
        and have a type parameter with the type of the underlying value
        - in this case string.
    </li>
    <li>
        The IsValid method is specific to EmailAddress, so it cannot be factored out.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is the SemanticType constructor that stores the value, so it needs to know how to validate it.
        To make that happen, simply pass the IsValid method as a parameter.
        If no validation is needed, pass in null.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the value is invalid, the SemanticType constructor throws an exception. It would be nice
        to mention the type that was going to be instantiated (in this case EmailAddress) in the exception.
        To make that happen, pass in the type of the derived class.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Another example is a BirthDate semantic type. This is a DateTime, except that birth dates must be in the past 
    (unless you take advance bookings for a kindergarten)
    and they can't be more than say 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_verified_oldest_people" target="_blank">130 years</a>
     in the past (unless you store dead people's details).
</p>

<pre>
public class BirthDate : SemanticType&lt;DateTime&gt;
{
    // Oldest person ever died at 122 year and 164 days
    // http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_verified_oldest_people
    // To be safe, reject any age over 130 years.
    const int maxAgeForHumans = 130;
    const int daysPerYear = 365;

    public static bool IsValid(DateTime birthDate)
    {
        TimeSpan age = DateTime.Now - birthDate;
        return (age.TotalDays &gt;= 0) && (age.TotalDays &lt; daysPerYear * maxAgeForHumans);
    }

    public BirthDate(DateTime birthDate) : base(IsValid, typeof(BirthDate), birthDate) { }
}
</pre>

<h2>Creating the SemanticType base class</h2>

<p>
    Lets start with the bare bones declaration:
</p>
<pre>
public class SemanticType&lt;T>
{
}
</pre>

<h3>Value property</h3>


<p>
    Add the Value property that will be used to store the underlying value. Note that it is of type T, the type of the underlying value:
</p>
<pre>
public class SemanticType&lt;T>
{
    <b>public T Value { get; private set; }</b>
}
</pre>

<h3>Constructor</h3>

<p>
    Now for the constructor. This acts as a gatekeeper by throwing an exception when the passed in value is invalid,
    thereby ensuring that if you have a semantic type, it is always valid. Note that:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        It doesn't allow null as a value. If you did allow null, there would be confusion between a null EmailAddress and an EmailAddress that has a null value.
    </li>
    <li>
     It uses the IsValid
    static method that was passed in via the isValidLambda parameter to do the validation.
    </li>
<li>
    It uses the type of the derived class (passed in via parameter derivedType) to create a more meaningful
    exception message.
</li>
</ul>

<pre>
public class SemanticType&lt;T>
{
    public T Value { get; private set; }

    <b>protected SemanticType(Func&lt;T, bool&gt; isValidLambda, Type derivedType, T value)
    {
        if ((Object)value == null)
        {
            throw new ArgumentException(string.Format("Trying to use null as the value of a {0}", derivedType));
        }

        if ((isValidLambda != null) && !isValidLambda(value))
        {
            throw new ArgumentException(string.Format("Trying to set a {0} to {1} which is invalid", derivedType, value));
        }

        Value = value;
    }</b>
}
</pre>

<h3>Equality related code</h3>

<p>
    Now we can implement the equality related code. First override the 
    <a href="" target="_blank">Equals</a>
    and
    <a href="" target="_blank">GetHashCode</a>
    methods inherited from
    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.object(v=vs.110).aspx" target="_blank">Object</a>.
</p>

<pre>
public class SemanticType&lt;T>
{
    public T Value { get; private set; }

    protected SemanticType(Func&lt;T, bool&gt; isValidLambda, Type derivedType, T value)
    {
        if ((Object)value == null)
        {
            throw new ArgumentException(string.Format("Trying to use null as the value of a {0}", derivedType));
        }

        if ((isValidLambda != null) && !isValidLambda(value))
        {
            throw new ArgumentException(string.Format("Trying to set a {0} to {1} which is invalid", derivedType, value));
        }

        Value = value;
    }

    <b>public override bool Equals(Object obj)
    {
        //Check for null and compare run-time types. 
        if (obj == null || obj.GetType() != this.GetType())
        {
            return false;
        }

        return (Value.Equals(((SemanticType&lt;T&gt;)obj).Value));
    }

    public override int GetHashCode()
    {
        return Value.GetHashCode();
    }</b>
}
</pre>

<h3>Implement IEquatable</h3>

<p>
    Now we can implement the 
    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms131187(v=vs.110).aspx" target="_blank">IEquatable</a>
    interface, by implementing its Equals method.
</p>
<p>
The difference between IEquatable.Equals and Object.Equals is that IEquatable.Equals is strongly typed.
    This has the following advantages:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        You get better type checking by the compiler.
    </li>
    <li>
        It makes testing for equality a bit more efficient when the underlying type is a value type, such as integer, because it prevents 
        <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-AU/library/yz2be5wk.aspx" target="_blank">boxing</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
<pre>
public class SemanticType&lt;T> : IEquatable&lt;SemanticType&lt;T&gt;&gt;
{
    public T Value { get; private set; }

    protected SemanticType(Func&lt;T, bool&gt; isValidLambda, Type derivedType, T value)
    {
        if ((Object)value == null)
        {
            throw new ArgumentException(string.Format("Trying to use null as the value of a {0}", derivedType));
        }

        if ((isValidLambda != null) && !isValidLambda(value))
        {
            throw new ArgumentException(string.Format("Trying to set a {0} to {1} which is invalid", derivedType, value));
        }

        Value = value;
    }

    public override bool Equals(Object obj)
    {
        //Check for null and compare run-time types. 
        if (obj == null || obj.GetType() != this.GetType())
        {
            return false;
        }

        return (Value.Equals(((SemanticType&lt;T&gt;)obj).Value));
    }

    public override int GetHashCode()
    {
        return Value.GetHashCode();
    }

    <b>public bool Equals(SemanticType&lt;T&gt; other)
    {
        if (other == null) { return false; }
            
        return (Value.Equals(other.Value));
    }</b>
}
</pre>

<h3>== and != operators</h3>


<p>
    Finally override the == and != operators:
</p>

<pre>
public class SemanticType&lt;T> : IEquatable&lt;SemanticType&lt;T&gt;&gt;
{
    public T Value { get; private set; }

    protected SemanticType(Func&lt;T, bool&gt; isValidLambda, Type derivedType, T value)
    {
        if ((Object)value == null)
        {
            throw new ArgumentException(string.Format("Trying to use null as the value of a {0}", derivedType));
        }

        if ((isValidLambda != null) && !isValidLambda(value))
        {
            throw new ArgumentException(string.Format("Trying to set a {0} to {1} which is invalid", derivedType, value));
        }

        Value = value;
    }

    public override bool Equals(Object obj)
    {

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    You saw how Semantic Types help you prevent bugs by getting the compiler to find them for you at compile time. They also 
    make it easier to understand your code by letting you specify that something is an email address, distance, temperature, etc.
    rather than just some string or double.
</p>
<p>
    You also saw how to create a SemanticType base class that makes it easy to create new semantic types
    without getting bogged down in lots of boilerplate.
