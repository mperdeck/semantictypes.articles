<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    Static typing is a great help in keeping your code bug free and maintainable. Take for example:
</p>
<pre>
public int mymethod(Person person)
{
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>
    A few good things are happening here:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    <b>Documentation</b>: You know right away that this method takes a Person and returns an integer.
    </li>
    <li>
<b>Machine Checking</b>: The compiler has been told as well. That means that this is not just documentation that can get out of date.
        The compiler actually makes sure that what you're reading here is true.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Tooling</b>: Finally, Visual Studio has been told too - enabling you to quickly find out how Person is defined.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    
    
    
    
    
    . , and you can be sure that the compiler actually checks
