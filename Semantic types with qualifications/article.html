<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    In the article
    <a href="#############">Reduce bugs in your code with semantic types</a>
    we saw how semantic types make it easier to write correct code.\
</p>
<p>
    Instead of storing email addresses, zip codes, etc. in simple strings,
    you introduce separate types, such as <i>EmailAddress</i>. That way, instead of relying on
    variable names and inline comments, you get the compiler itself to ensure you're not 
    assigning surnames to email addresses, and it lets you put validation right in the type itself.
</p>
<p>
    However, sometimes a semantic type is really a family of types, that need to be further qualified.
    This article shows where this comes into play and how qualification works.
</p>

<h2>Qualification by type</h2>

<p>
Take these two classes:
</p>

<pre>
public class Author
{
    public int AuthorId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Address { get; set; }
}

public class Book
{
    public int BookId { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public int AuthorId { get; set; }
}
</pre>

<p>
It describes an <i>Author</i> and a <i>Book</i>, each with their own ids.
    And each Book carries the id of its author.
    Lets assume they represent rows in the Author and Book tables in a SQL Server database.
</p>

<p>
    One problem with these classes is the fact that the ids are of type int.
Ids in SQL Server are always greater than 0, while values of type int can be 0 and even negative.
    Additionally, we want to make it clear in the code when we're using a database id rather than any old int. 
</p>

<p>
    As described in
    <a href="#############">Reduce bugs in your code with semantic types</a>,
    this can be fixed by introducing a semantic type for database ids:
</p>

<pre>
public class DatabaseId : SemanticType&lt;int, DatabaseId&gt;
{
    // Database ids must be greater than 0.
    static DatabaseId() { IsValid = v =&gt; v &gt; 0; }

    public DatabaseId(int id) : base(id) { }
}

// Ids now use semantic type DatabaseId

public class Book
{
    public <b>DatabaseId</b> BookId { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public <b>DatabaseId</b> AuthorId { get; set; }
}

public class Author
{
    public <b>DatabaseId</b> AuthorId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Address { get; set; }
}
</pre>

<p>
    This isn't quite good enough though. 
    It still allows you to assign a BookId to an AuthorId:
</p>

<pre>
public DatabaseId getAuthorIdByName(string authorName)
{
    ...
}

public Book getBookByBookId(DatabaseId bookId)
{
    ...
}

DatabaseId unclearVariableName = getAuthorIdByName("Ernest Hemingway");

// ... some code in some method far far away ...

// Passing an author id to a method that expects a book id
Book book = getBookByBookId(unclearVariableName);
</pre>

<p>

    Although both AuthorId and BookId are database ids, 
    you still can't mix them. They are of the same family, but they're not the same.
</p>

<p>
    One way to solve this would be to create separate semantic types for 
    AuthorId and BookId. But than you'd need to do that for every id
    in your code base. That sounds laborious.
</p>

<p>
    An easier alternative is to simply make DatabaseId generic and qualify it with a dummy type, 
    like so:
</p>

<pre>
public class DatabaseId<b>&lt;Q&gt;</b> : SemanticType&lt;int, DatabaseId<b>&lt;Q&gt;</b>&gt;
{
    // Database ids must be greater than 0.
    static DatabaseId() { IsValid = v =&gt; v &gt; 0; }

    public DatabaseId(int id) : base(id) { }
}
</pre>

<p>
    The type parameter Q is not actually used anywhere inside the DatabaseId type.
    It is simply used to create different versions of DatabaseId, like so:
</p>

<pre>
public class Book
{
    public DatabaseId<b>&lt;Book&gt;</b> BookId { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public DatabaseId<b>&lt;Author&gt;</b> AuthorId { get; set; }
}

public class Author
{
    public DatabaseId<b>&lt;Author&gt;</b> AuthorId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Address { get; set; }
}
</pre>

<p>
    The compiler will not let us assign a 
    DatabaseId&lt;Book&gt;
        to a 
    DatabaseId&lt;Author&gt;.
    Essentially, by passing in different types to DatabaseId, we're telling the compiler to create different types, but without
    having to create these types ourselves.
</p>
<p>
    The faulty code now no longer compiles, providing immediate feedback about the problem:
</p>
<pre>

public DatabaseId&lt;Author&gt; getAuthorIdByName(string authorName)
{
    ...
}

public Book getBookByBookId(DatabaseId&lt;Book&gt; bookId)
{
    ...
}

DatabaseId&lt;Author&gt; unclearVariableName = getAuthorIdByName("Ernest Hemingway");

// ... some code in some method far far away ...

// NO LONGER COMPILES, because trying to pass a DatabaseId&lt;Author&gt; to a DatabaseId&lt;Book&gt;
Book book = getBookByBookId(unclearVariableName);
</pre>
